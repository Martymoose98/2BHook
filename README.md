## Installation

Since this mod is a dynamic link library (DLL) it cannot be used on it's own and needs a DLL injector such as Extreme Injector or Xenos etc... 
Alternatively, a proxy DLL loader will also suffice.

Acquire a DLL injector or proxy DLL loader.

Download the 2B Hook DLL here (Choose the latest release build unless you know what you are doing)

Open the injector and select the DLL

Open NieR:Automata (It's probably best to wait until the game is in the main menu. Not doing so could result in undefined behaviour!)

Inject!

Any crash dumps (.dmp files) are located in the same folder as NieR:Automata. They should be relayed to me (see Contact section) or create a github issue if you want it to get fixed!
It might not dump if you close the "NieR:Automata has stopped working" dialog prematurely.

## Usage

## Todo

- Add more features of course
